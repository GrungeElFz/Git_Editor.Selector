- **Supported Editors**: Ensure your preferred editors are installed and accessible via command line (e.g., `code` for VS Code, `cursor` for Cursor).

> **Note:**
> Don't forget to install the command-line `PATH` for each IDE to make the IDE accessible from the command line.
> Here‚Äôs how you can do it for some common editors:

## Installation

1. Clone the Repository

   ```zsh
   git clone https://github.com/GrungeElFz/Git_Editor.Selector.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the Directory

   ```zsh
   cd Git_Editor.Selector
   ```

3. Add the Script to Your Zsh Configuration

   You can add the script directly to your `.zshrc` or source it as a separate file.

   - **Option 1**: Directly in `.zshrc`

     Open your .zshrc file:

     ```zsh
     nano ~/.zshrc
     ```

     Paste the contents of the Git_Editor.Selector script into your `.zshrc` file.

     ***

   - **Option 2**: Source as a Separate File

     Save the `Git_Editor.Selector` script to a file (e.g., `~/.zsh/git_editor_selector.zsh`)

     ```zsh
     mkdir -p ~/.zsh
     nano ~/.zsh/git_editor_selector.zsh
     ```

     Paste the script into this file and save.

     Then, add the following line to your .zshrc to source the script:

     ```zsh
     source ~/.zsh/git_editor_selector.zsh
     ```

4. Reload Your `Zsh` Configuration
   ```zsh
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

## Configuration

### Initial Setup

After installation, perform the initial setup to configure your preferred editors and aliases.

1. Run Initialization Command

   ```zsh
   g setup
   ```

2. Follow the Interactive Prompts

- **Select Editors**: You'll be presented with a list of available editors. Choose the ones you want to configure.

- **Aliases Configuration**: Decide whether to use default aliases or set custom ones for each editor.

- **Default Editor Selection**: Choose which editor should be the default when you execute `code` commands.

3. Restart Your Shell

   To apply the changes, restart the shell andterminal:

   ```zsh
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

### Editing Aliases

You can edit your editor aliases at any time using the `g config` command.

```zsh
g config
```

This will open the `aliases.conf` file in your selected editor, allowing you to modify aliases as needed. After editing, reload your shell to apply the changes.

## Usage

Git Editor Selector provides a wrapper function `g` that replaces the standard git command, offering enhanced capabilities.

### Using the Git Wrapper (`g`)

#### Standard Commands

All standard Git commands are supported. Use `g` in place of `git`:

```zsh
g add .
g commit -m "Message"
g push origin main
```

#### Enhanced Commands

- Initialization

  ```zsh
  g setup
  ```

  Sets up the Git Editor Selector by configuring editors and aliases.

- Configuration

  ```zsh
  g config
  ```

  Opens the `aliases.conf` file for editing your editor aliases.

- Commit

  ```zsh
  g commit

  Checking for running editors
  üèÉÔ∏è...

  Multiple editors are running. Please choose the editor for git commit:
  (1) VS Code
  (2) Zed
  (3) Cursor
  üëâ 2

  Using Zed as the git editor.
  hint: Waiting for your editor to close the file...
  ```

  - Using `g commit` while having multiple editors running will prompt to choose the editor to be used for this git editor.

  - If there's only one editor running, the script will automatically route to the running one.

## Supported Editors

By default, Git Editor Selector supports the following editors:

1. Visual Studio Code

   - Name: VS Code
   - Process Pattern: Visual Studio Code
   - Command: `code`
   - Alias: `vsc`

2. Zed

   - Name: Zed
   - Process Pattern: Zed
   - Command: `zed`
   - Alias: `zed`

3. Cursor

   - Name: Cursor
   - Process Pattern: Cursor
   - Command: `cursor`
   - Alias: `cur`

### Adding More Editors

To add more editors:

1. Edit the Git_Editor.Selector Script

   Locate the `EDITORS` array in the script and add your editor in the following format:

   ```zsh
   "Editor Name:Process Pattern:Editor Command"
   ```

   Example:

   ```zsh
   EDITORS=(
    "VS Code:Visual Studio Code:code"
    "Zed:Zed:zed"
    "Cursor:Cursor:cursor"
    "Sublime Text:Sublime Text:subl"
   )
   ```

2. Update Default Aliases

   If you want to set a default alias for the new editor, add it to the `default_aliases` associative array:

   ```zsh
   default_aliases=(
     ["VS Code"]="vsc"
     ["Zed"]="zed"
     ["Cursor"]="cur"
     ["Sublime Text"]="subl"
   )
   ```

3. Run Configuration Again

   After making changes, run `g init` to reconfigure aliases.

## Customization

- Default Editor

  Set your preferred default editor by modifying the `DEFAULT_EDITOR` variable in the script:

  ```zsh
  DEFAULT_EDITOR="code"  # Change 'code' to your preferred editor command
  ```

- Aliases Configuration

  Customize your editor aliases by editing the `~/.config/git_editor_selector/aliases.conf` file.

  ```zsh
  [aliases]
  vsc = VS Code
  zed = Zed
  cur = Cursor
  code = VS Code
  ```

## Troubleshooting

- Aliases Configuration File Not Found

  If you encounter an error about the aliases configuration file not being found, run:

  ```zsh
  g setup
  ```

- Editor Not Opening

  Ensure that the editor's command is correctly specified and that the editor is installed. You can test the command directly in the terminal:

  ```zsh
  code .
  ```

- Environment Variable `$EDITOR` Not Set

  If no editors are running and the `$EDITOR` environment variable is not set, Git Editor Selector defaults to `DEFAULT_EDITOR`.

  To set `$EDITOR`, add the following to your `.zshrc`:

  ```zsh
  export EDITOR="code"  # Replace 'code' with your preferred editor
  ```

  Then, restart the shell and terminal.

  ```zsh
  source ~/.zshrc
  ```
